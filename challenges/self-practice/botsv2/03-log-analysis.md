# BOTS v2 — Stage 3: Log Analysis (Reading Every Sourcetype)

Now you read the actual security logs. v2 has **104 sourcetypes** across many
technologies — the skill is knowing *what each one tells you* and *how to get
fields out of it*. Crucial lesson up front:

> 🔑 **Not every sourcetype is field-extracted.** This lab ships no vendor
> TAs, so some sources give you clean fields and some are raw text you must
> `rex`. **Always check first:** `… sourcetype=X | head 1` and look at
> `_raw` vs. the field sidebar. Verified state below.

| Sourcetype | Format | Fields extracted? | How you read it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `access_combined` | Apache combined | ✅ yes | `clientip method uri status bytes useragent` |
| `wineventlog:security` | key=value | ✅ yes | `EventCode`, `ComputerName`, `Message` (e.g. 4688/4624/4625) |
| `xmlwineventlog:…sysmon…` | XML | ✅ via lab add-on | `EventCode`, `Image`, `CommandLine`, … |
| `stream:*` (dns/http/smb/smtp/ftp/tcp) | JSON | ✅ yes | JSON keys, e.g. `query{}`, `src_ip`, `dest_ip`, `filename` |
| `suricata` | JSON | ✅ yes | `alert.signature`, `alert.category`, `src_ip` |
| `winregistry` | key=value | ✅ yes | `key_path`, `registry_type`, `data` |
| `symantec:ep:*` | CSV-ish | ✅ mostly | comma fields; inspect `_raw` |
| `pan:traffic` | **CSV** | ❌ no (no PAN TA) | **`rex`/positional** — comma-separated |
| `linux_secure`, `auditd` | syslog text | ❌ no | **`rex`** the message |
| `mysql:*`, `osquery_results` | JSON/mixed | ⚠️ JSON → `spath` | `spath`, or read `_raw` then `rex` |

⏱ **Time picker — Stage 3** (depends on the source you're reading)

| Questions | Time picker |
|---|---|
| Q41–Q43 (Windows endpoint / Sysmon) | `08/24/2017 00:00:00` → `08/25/2017 00:00:00` |
| Q44–Q47 (web / DNS / IDS / Palo Alto) | `08/23/2017 00:00:00` → `08/24/2017 00:00:00` |
| Q48–Q53 (Linux SSH / MySQL / correlation) | single day, e.g. `08/24/2017 00:00:00` → `08/25/2017 00:00:00` (or `tstats` for counts) |
| Q54–Q60 (APT artifacts: SMTP/FTP/registry/osquery/C2) | `08/15/2017 00:00:00` → `08/26/2017 00:00:00` |

> **Hints are nudges, not answers** — they name the sourcetype, fields, and
> approach. Write the SPL yourself; the full query + verified result is in
> [SOLUTIONS.md](SOLUTIONS.md) (Stage 3), for a last resort. v2 is 226M events
> — always scope, or use `tstats`/keyword searches.

## Windows endpoint

### Q41 — Process creation (Windows 4688)
`wineventlog:security` logs process creation as EventCode 4688.
**Hint:** Filter to `EventCode=4688`, then `stats count by ComputerName` and `sort` descending. Note `ComputerName` carries the `…frothly.local` FQDN.

### Q42 — Logon success/failure (4624 / 4625)
**Hint:** Filter to `EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4625`, then `stats count by EventCode ComputerName`. A 4625 spike on one host = credential attack.

### Q43 — Sysmon process detail
Sysmon (`*ysmon*`) gives you the `CommandLine` that 4688 often lacks here.
**Hint:** `EventCode=1` on the Sysmon sourcetype, scope to `host=wrk-*`, and `table` `_time host Image CommandLine ParentImage` sorted by time. Hunt scripting hosts / odd parents.

## Web & network (extracted)

### Q44 — Web request analysis
**Hint:** `stats count by status method` on the day's `access_combined`, `sort` descending; then eyeball `uri` for odd paths.

### Q45 — DNS via Splunk Stream (JSON)
**Hint:** `stats count by query{}` on `stream:dns`, `sort` descending. Group by `query{}` (the DNS question, always present) — same rule as v1.

### Q46 — Suricata IDS alerts
**Hint:** `stats count by alert.signature alert.category` on `suricata`, `sort` descending. You'll spot scanning (port 135), TOR, and an **OSX backdoor** signature — pointers for Stage 4.

## The sources that need `rex` (no TA)

### Q47 — Palo Alto firewall (`pan:traffic`, CSV)
The log is raw CSV: `… ,TRAFFIC,end,…,<src_ip>,<dest_ip>,…,<src_user>,…,<app>,…`. There are no auto-fields.
**Hint:** Read `_raw` first to count the comma positions, then `rex` positionally to pull the fields you want (`src_ip`, `dest_ip`, `src_user`) and `stats count by` them. The domain is `frothly.local`; users appear as `frothly.local\<user>`.

### Q48 — Linux SSH brute force (`linux_secure`, syslog)
Raw syslog like `Failed password for root from 116.31.116.52 port 23301 ssh2`.
**Hint:** Search `linux_secure` for `"Failed password"`, `rex` the source IP (and user) out of the message, `stats count by src_ip`, `sort`. One external IP with tens of thousands of failures = brute force (verified: `58.242.83.20` hammering `gacrux`).

### Q49 — Linux auditd / osquery
**Hint:** Inspect the shape first (`sourcetype=auditd | head 20`, `sourcetype=osquery_results | head 5`), then pick the parser: `osquery_results` is JSON → `spath`; `auditd` is key=value-ish → `rex`. The deliverable is knowing which parser fits.

### Q50 — MySQL activity
**Hint:** Read `stream:mysql` raw (`| head`) — the on-wire SQL sits in a `query`-style field. For "which host is the DB server?", `tstats count by host` on `mysql:*`; one host dominates the whole index.

## Putting sources together

### Q51 — Same event, two sources
Pick a process-creation moment on a workstation and view it from *both* `wineventlog:security` (4688) and Sysmon (EID 1). What does each give you that the other doesn't? (Sysmon → hashes/CommandLine; WinEventLog → account/logon context.)

### Q52 — Correlate a host across telemetry
For `wrk-bgist`, pull a slice of Sysmon + wineventlog + stream:dns in one window and read the story.
**Hint:** Search the host across all three sourcetypes at once (an `OR` of the three), `sort` by `_time`, and `table` the key columns (`sourcetype`, `EventCode`, `Image`, `query{}`) so the sequence reads top-to-bottom.

### Q53 — Which host is which? Build an asset picture
**Hint:** `tstats count by host sourcetype`, then infer roles: `cassiopeia`/`venus`/`jupiter` (servers — perfmon/mysql/pan), `wrk-*` (workstations — Sysmon), and two Macs `maclory-air13` + `kutekitten` (both carry `osquery_results`) — `kutekitten` (`10.0.4.2`) is the OSX-backdoor host.

## Email, endpoint AV & file transfer

### Q54 — Email (`stream:smtp`) — attachments tell the story
Mail flows through `stream:smtp`. Skip the sparse `sender_email` and go straight to what was *attached*.
**Hint:** `stats count by "attach_filename{}"` (mind the `{}` — it's a multivalue JSON field, quote it). Two very different threats surface: `invoice.zip` (the Taedonggang phishing lure) and `Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_patent.docx` (an *insider* sending IP to a competitor). Same sourcetype, two incidents.

### Q55 — Endpoint AV (`symantec:ep:*`)
Symantec Endpoint Protection lands as several `symantec:ep:*` sourcetypes.
**Hint:** Enumerate them first with `tstats count … by sourcetype`. `packet:file`/`traffic:file` dominate (network), while `:security:file` and `:behavior:file` have just **1** event each — the rare, high-signal ones. Read a `:security:file` event's `_raw` (comma-separated: host, event, `Local:`/`Remote:` IPs, `User:`, `Domain:`).

### Q56 — File transfer (`stream:ftp`) — the tooling drop
FTP carries file names in the `filename` field; `loadway` says Download vs Upload.
**Hint:** Filter `stream:ftp` to `loadway=Download`, then `stats count by filename src_ip dest_ip`. From one FTP server (`160.153.91.7`) the attacker pulled a whole toolkit onto the beaching hosts (`10.0.2.107`/`10.0.2.109`): `psexec.exe`, `nc.exe`, `wget64.exe`, `winsys64.dll`, `python-2.7.6.amd64.msi`, `dns.py` — plus one **unusual file for an American company**: a Korean-named `.hwp` (Hangul word-processor) document.

### Q57 — TLS metadata (`stream:tcp`) — SSL issuer of the C2
When C2 is HTTPS you can't read the payload, but the TLS handshake metadata is still in `stream:tcp`.
**Hint:** Scope `stream:tcp` to the C2 IP, then `stats count by ssl_issuer`. The issuer is a suspiciously bare **`C = US`** (no org/CN) — a self-signed-looking cert is itself an indicator.

### Q58 — Registry persistence (`winregistry`)
`winregistry` is huge (~55M events) but the APT's persistence blob is findable by keyword.
**Hint:** Keyword-search `Network` + `debug`, then `stats count by key_path`. The value lives at `HKLM\software\microsoft\network\debug` — a base64 PowerShell-Empire payload the scheduled task re-reads at run time (a "fileless" persistence trick). Pull `data` to see the blob.

### Q59 — macOS endpoint (`osquery_results`) — confirm the Mac malware
The Mac (`kutekitten`) has no real-time EDR, but `osquery_results` snapshots its files — enough to confirm the backdoor on-host.
**Hint:** Scope `osquery_results` to `host=kutekitten` and Mallory's home (`columns.path="/Users/mkraeusen*"`). The rows carry `columns.sha256`/`columns.path`, so you can pull the suspicious file's hash and check it externally — this is exactly how the incident IDs the `fpsaud`/FruitFly malware. IDS *alerts*, osquery *confirms*.

### Q60 — One indicator, every view (Stage-4 warm-up)
Take the C2 IP `45.77.65.211` and count how many *different* sourcetypes saw it.
**Hint:** Search the bare IP across the whole index (wide window) and `stats count by sourcetype`, `sort` descending. It appears across `pan:traffic`, `suricata`, `stream:tcp/ip/http`, and `access_combined` — **one indicator confirmed by six independent sources** is the report-grade finding you'll build on in Stage 4.
